# But, why?

While this initially served as a different version of [Treedoff](https://github.com/SivanMehta/treedoff), it has now been re-adapted to help me learn [Go](https://golang.org/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I am writing the client-side in React and Go for the server side.

# Project Goals

- Develop all of the below features
- Figure out how to deploy (will probably involve a CDN and separate Go instance)

## React Goals

- Use new and exciting libraries to make a fluid and intuitive UI.
- Implement basic site like browsing, chat, and responsiveness.

## Go Goals (or simply just GOals)

- Learn Go in literally any capacity (I'm new to this)
- Setup chat via [websockets](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)
- Setup some kind of authorization with FB
- Persist users with LevelDB
- Do some kind of concurrency, as that's really something I should learn in some capacity as a budding software engineer.
